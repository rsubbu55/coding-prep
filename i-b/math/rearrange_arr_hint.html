  <p>If you had extra space to do it, the problem will be very easy. <br />
Store a copy of Arr in B.</p>

<p>And then for every element, do Arr[i] = B[B[i]]</p>

<p>Lets restate what we just said for extra space :</p>

<p>If we could somehow store 2 numbers in every index ( that is, Arr[i] can contani the old value, and the new value somehow ), then the problem becomes very easy. <br />
NewValue of Arr[i] = OldValue of Arr[OldValue of Arr[i]]</p>

<p>Now, we will do a slight trick to encode 2 numbers in one index. <br />
This trick assumes that <code class="highlighter-rouge">N * N</code> does not overflow.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>1) Increase every Array element Arr[i] by (Arr[Arr[i]] % n)*n.
2) Divide every element by N.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Given a number as <br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
   A = B + C * N   if ( B, C &lt; N )
   A % N = B
   A / N = C
</code></p>

<p>We use this fact to encode 2 numbers into each element of Arr.</p>
