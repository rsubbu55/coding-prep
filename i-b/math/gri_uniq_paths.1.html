  <p>There is a mathematical approach to solving this problem.</p>

<p>Note that you have to take <strong>m + n - 2</strong> steps in total. You have to take (m - 1) steps going down and (n-1) steps going right.</p>

<p>Let 0 denote a down step and 1 denote a right step.</p>

<p>So we need to find out the number of strings of length m + n - 2 which have exactly <strong>m - 1</strong> zeroes and <strong>n - 1</strong> ones.</p>

<p>Essentially we need to choose the positions of ‘1s’, and then ‘0s’ fall into the remaining positions.</p>

<p>So, the answer becomes Choose(m+n-2, n - 1).</p>
