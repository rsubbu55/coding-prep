  <p>Lets look at the number of valid possibilities for A^B.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>
For B = 2, number of possibilities = sqrt(INT_MAX) = sqrt(2^31 - 1) &lt; 2^16.
For B = 3, number of possibilities = INT_MAX**1/3 &lt; 2^11
For B = 4, number of possibilities = INT_MAX**1/4 &lt; 2^8
.
.
.
For B = 32, number of possibilities = 0 ( Not considering 1 as its considered in the first case, and 2^32 exceeds INT_MAX ). 

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>So, the total number of possibilities are less than 10^5.</p>

<p>Now, we just need to iterate on these possibilities and see if we find X = A^B.</p>

<p><strong>Take extra care to make sure there are no overflows.</strong></p>
